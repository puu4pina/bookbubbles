# App

This app uses Open Library API to fetch subjects of a book and then visualizes them in a bubble chart. The more frequent the subject, the bigger its bubble. 
See: 
https://openlibrary.org/developers/api

# Instructions
1. Give book title and author name, and search.
2. Click "Visualize" to see a bubble chart of the subjcets.
3. Select "Clear" if you want to empty the subjects from session.
4. In edge cases you're instructed what to do i.e. if a book with matching author and title were found, but the match didn't include any subjects, you can add one manually.
